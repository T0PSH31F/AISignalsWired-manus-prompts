## Risk Analysis

### Threats & Mitigations

**1. Low Win Rate (Catastrophic)**
- **Risk**: Platform performs < 65%, users churn, reputation damaged
- **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers, 30-day testing before launch, conservative strategies
- **Backup**: Money-back guarantee builds trust despite failures

**2. Competition (High)**
- **Risk**: Established players with larger budgets launch similar product
- **Mitigation**: Differentiate on transparency, multi-asset, API; build moat with community
- **Backup**: Fast iteration based on user feedback

**3. Regulatory (Medium)**
- **Risk**: SEC/FINRA cracks down on signal providers, requires licensing
- **Mitigation**: Disclaimers ("not financial advice"), LLC formation, E&O insurance
- **Backup**: Consult securities lawyer if scaling beyond $1M ARR

**4. API Rate Limits (Medium)**
- **Risk**: Free tier APIs (CoinGecko, AlphaVantage) rate limit, block access
- **Mitigation**: Caching with Redis, upgrade to paid API tiers early
- **Backup**: Multiple data providers (CCXT, Financial Datasets MCP)

**5. Churn (High in early days)**
- **Risk**: Users subscribe, don't see immediate value, cancel
- **Mitigation**: Onboarding sequence, quick wins, excellent support, transparent performance
- **Backup**: Annual plans (20% discount), lock-in with API integrations
